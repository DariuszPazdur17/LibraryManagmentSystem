# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## How it works?
### Description 
The author of the project presents a solution to improve the operations of the B5 departmental library. The idea of the project is presented, as well as the inspiration the author drew from when creating the project. The project presents an analysis of student needs and draws conclusions on how we can improve the lives of students and university staff. The project is a web application, which is a library system built in React language, additionally connected to FireBase database, which contains records of books in the library. The solutions used in the project were given and the most important functions of the application's operation were presented, such as:
- Logging
- Registration
- Adding and deleting books
- Prolonging records
- Adding items to favorites
- Borrowing
- Searching for items
In the following part of the work the functionality was discussed based on screenshots of the application's code, finally tests were carried out on different browsers in order to ensure the best possible user experience of the application.
Finally, the author's conclusions were presented, ideas for others that came up during the development of the project. Also summarized was the knowledge gained during the study at the university, which was necessary to create the application.
